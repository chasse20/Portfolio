			"description": "The Operational Environment Data Integration Network (ODIN) is a training resource designed for the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). The goal of the project was to digitize all existing Worldwide Equipment Guide (WEG), Decisive Action Training Environment (DATE 3.0), Force Structures (FS) and Training Publication (TC) data into one, online authoritative resource. It includes both a user-friendly frontend, a visual editor for content management, and machine-readable API endpoints for use in simulations. It has been highly acclaimed by TRADOC and is the flagship for future training digitization efforts.",
